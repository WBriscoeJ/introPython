#1. In your own words, describe what a for loop is?
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, 
#a set, or a string).

 #For loop is used when the number of iterations is already known.
  #While loop is used when the number of iterations is already Unknown

# 2. What is the difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE loop?
# Provide two (2) examples of each. A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known,
#where as execution is done in a while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.



# 3. Create a FOR loop that will go through a list of names 
# and print all the names that start with the letter "R".

names = ['Michael','Rebecca','William','Kareem','Robert','Rose','Jason']

for  firstLetter in names:
    if firstLetter[0] == "R":
        print(firstLetter)
