You will design and develop your very own orginal program application. Your program should take in a user's input or commands, perform at least three (3) different types of functionality on the user input data, and then out put some type of data.

(By functionality, it should be able to do any of the things we've learned in class such as loops, conditionals, data casting, etc. )

DO NOT PUT LIMITS ON YOURSELF OR WHAT YOU CAN DEVELOP whatever you elect to design, you can do it with Python.
